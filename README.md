# readWrite
 WriteToFileFromUserInput

The project takes user input from a console window, then creates a file and writes the user input to that file. The file does not need to be deleted in order to rerun the project as the file that it produces increments the date time creation of the file to be that of when it was created and joins this together with filename, in this case "test" and outputs it to the directory of the project.
